# Modern Auth FAQ

These are some of most frequent questions about OpenID Connect and OAuth.

1. How do we control and segregate access in our backend API?

2. We have some applications that need to interact with each other without a user directly involved. How can an app get authorized to access another one?

3. We have an API and we need to implement AuthN and AuthZ to it. Can we use SAML for that?

4. Why aren't NTML and Kerberos suitable for the cloud?

5. For SPAs, should we use the Implicit or the Authorization Code with PKCE grant type?
